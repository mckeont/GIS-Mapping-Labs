# GUS-3062/5062-Fundamentals of Geographic Information systems
## Lab 1. Introduction of ArcGIS Pro ([link](Lab_01_Introduction_to_ArcGIS.md))
1. To introduce ArcGIS Pro and its basic data management, display, and analysis components. 
2. To learn how to work with map layers, query attribute tables and geographic features, create maps, and design and execute a simple GIS analysis. 
3. Map and analyze data from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

## Lab 2. Projections and Coordinate Systems ([link](Lab_02_Projections_and_CRS.md))
1. To introduce concepts in map projection, and common operations in working with coordinate reference systems (CRSs). 
2. To learn how to make more complex map layouts for reference cartography. 
3. As a demonstration, you will investigate properties of CRSs for large scale data in for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as well as global data.

## Lab. 3: Thematic Mapping ([link](Lab_03_Thematic_Mapping.md))
1. To introduce the principles and techniques of thematic mapping, including dot density, proportional symbol, and choropleth mapping, as well as data classification and basic map design. 
2. As a demonstration, you will acquire and map spatial data from the 2010 U.S. Census.

## Lab 4. Tables and Attribute Data ([link](Lab_04_Tables_and_Attribute_Data.md))
1. To become familiar with the relational data model.
2. Be familar with the implementation of relational data model in a GIS software package.
3. Know table join, data export, sorting, summarizing, creating new fields, and calculating values for fields based on table and geometric calculations.

## Lab 5. Digitization/ Creating and Editing Map Data ([link](Lab_05_Creating_Geographic_Data.md))
1. To introduce the basics of georeferencing and digitizing in ArcGIS. 
2. As a demonstration, you will georeference historical maps and compare the data to more recent spatial data for areas in Massachusetts and Utah.

## Lab 6. Vector Operations ([link](Lab_06_Vector_Operations.md))
To introduce vector operations, including buffer, dissolve, and overlay operations.


## Lab 7. Introduction to Raster Analysis ([link](Lab_07_Raster_Operations.md))
1. To introduce raster data, including elevation and land cover data sets. 
2. To introduce raster data manipulation, including mosaic, mask, and projection.
3.  To introduce raster analysis, including terrain visualization and analysis, as well as map algebra. 
4. As a demonstration, you will work with elevation and land cover data for Delaware County, Pennsylvania.
